# Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## The Issue
Your Railway deployment failed during the build process.

## Files Added to Fix:
1. ✅ `railway.json` - Railway configuration
2. ✅ `Dockerfile` - Build instructions  
3. ✅ `healthcheck.js` - Health monitoring
4. ✅ Updated `package.json` with Node.js version
5. ✅ `.dockerignore` - Optimize build

## Next Steps:
1. Commit and push these fixes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. In Railway dashboard:
   - Go to **Settings** → **General**
   - Set **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - Ensure Environment Variables are set
   - Redeploy

## If Still Failing:
- Check the build logs in Railway for specific error messages
- Verify MongoDB connection string is correct
- Ensure all environment variables are set

## Alternative Platforms:
- **Render**: render.com (similar to Railway)
- **Heroku**: heroku.com (paid but reliable)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: digitalocean.com
